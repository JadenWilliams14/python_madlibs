    **Multiple Word Options from a List**


3. **Why You Chose Those Challenge(s)**  
    I chose to implement the List feature, because I liked 3 aspects of this challenge:
      1. I wanted to work with an imported object which random is.
      2. I wanted to double check that I understood how split functioned and that I could utilize it correctly.
      3. I liked the idea that the user might not know for sure which words are being used in the story each time.
